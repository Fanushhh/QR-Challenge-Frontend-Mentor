## My process

First things first, I mainly focused on understanding what was going on on the design folder of the project and also the challenge website, what were the details of the challenge, the steps, I tried to identify what positioning was used before actually adding it.
After that, I downloaded the folder, created my css folder where I started styling the pages side by side with the design folder opened so I can see what I'm aiming for.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid & Media Queries

### What I learned

This challenge was pretty easy to figure out, except that I had to figure some positioning using the naked eye for some things, such as "Is the text-description properly aligned with the title of the card and so on :D

I did however learned more about Media Queries and how to position elements using it as I noticed first-hand that there is a big emphasis on mobile responsiveness, so I had to modify the box to fit in a mobile resolution as well which was fun.

### Continued development

I plan on learning more about CSS properties that can be modified as I feel like I barely scratched the surface, I want to learn about the true power.

### Useful resources
